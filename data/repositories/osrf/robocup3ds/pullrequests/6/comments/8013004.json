The code is using the new server architecture, thus I think it is following the proposed diagram. Currently Some modules of Effector_box  should be improved and also should be tested in different conditions (the new Parser_Test is not ready yet).\n\nSome part of the diagram is not very clear to me: \n\n1- Which block will update socket_ID in GameState_box, I think it is Server? (line directly from server to gameState)\n\n2- In the update part of the effector_box, we want to have the latest value of effectors or only we want to have effectors values in the current cycle? for each simulation cycle we will have different effectors number.
