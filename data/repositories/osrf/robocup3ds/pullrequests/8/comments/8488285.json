Your code integrates with Agent Class better so some containers in effector class is not needed any more and it has been deleted. I think generally, Now the effector class is integrated with the rest of the classes better, thank you. \nOnly one note, In new code,  Update() is executed only once every simulation cycle, In this case we will miss the message information in when an agent sends two messages  during one simulation cycle. I think some messages like init() and Beam() are like an event to the simulator and simulator should know that this messages are sent by the agents. Lets think about a scenario: the agent will send init message and in the same cycle the agent will also send another message, in this case the other message will over write the init message. by the update(), we will not analyse the init message and we will not create that agent. Because of that, I had the idea in previous implementation to update the message in parse() method. I think for the new implementation, it is also possible to move the update to the Parse() method.\n\nI will merge with your branch , I have also implemented the say command parser and am going to commit it after merge. For Effector_test, since now we dont have the data structures and accessors methods of the Effector class, I will test the data imported to agent class.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Jason, I read the code, I saw that the update() now changes totally and it also handles the process of several agents messages as the previous implementation handles it too.
