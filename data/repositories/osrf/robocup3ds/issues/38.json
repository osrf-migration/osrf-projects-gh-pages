Nao position is sometimes reset as expected, but sometimes it is not. Suppose Nao initial beam is (0, 0, 0) and its current position is (-2, 3, 0). Now setting Before-Kickoff resets Nao position to a point near its last position (e.g. (-2.1, 3.2, 0)) instead of its initial beam i.e. (0, 0, 0). \r\nCould anyone tell me what might cause such a behavior?\r\nBest regards,\r\nNavid", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi,\nI need the ability to reset player position whenever I set the play mode to Before-Kickoff by sending a monitor message.
